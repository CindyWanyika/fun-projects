🐍 Cindy’s Python Fun Projects
Hey there! Welcome to my collection of little Python projects.
This repo is where I experiment, try out new things, and have fun coding. Some of these might not be perfect, but they’re all part of my learning journey. 😊
I created this space to explore, have fun, and learn more about Python. These projects aren’t fancy or perfect—they’re just me having fun with code!
Have fun:3
